    "The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource, and the data is sent as a query string in the URL. In other words, the data is visible in the URL. GET requests are usually used to retrieve data, such as web pages or API endpoints. Since the data is visible in the URL, GET requests are not recommended for sending sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "POST:\n",
    "The POST method is used to submit data to a specified resource, such as submitting a form or creating a new resource. The data is sent in the body of the request and is not visible in the URL. POST requests are recommended for sending sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, as the data is not visible in the URL.\n",

    "\n",
    "The request object in Flask provides various methods and attributes to access this data. For example, the request.method attribute is used to get the HTTP method used in the request (such as GET or POST), while the request.args attribute is used to access query parameters sent in the URL.\n",

    "Getting the HTTP method used in the request\n",
