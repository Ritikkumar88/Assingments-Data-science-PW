    "SQL and NoSQL are two main types of databases that differ in their data storage and retrieval approaches. SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. The data is structured and follows a schema that defines the relationships between the tables. SQL databases use SQL as a query language to retrieve and manipulate data. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",

    "On the other hand, NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that store data in a non-tabular format. The data is usually stored in collections, documents, or key-value pairs, and does not follow a fixed schema. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of unstructured data. NoSQL databases use different query languages depending on the type of database. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Redis.\n",
