    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. He was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands at the time, and he created Python as a hobby project to overcome some of the limitations of the ABC programming language. Van Rossum continued to develop Python throughout the 1990s, and it was first released to the public in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Since then, Python has evolved into a powerful and versatile programming language that is used in a wide range of applications, from web development and data science to scientific computing and artificial intelligence."
